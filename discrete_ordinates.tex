\chapter{Discrete Ordinates Method}
\label{lec:discreteordinates}

In the last two lectures, we dealt exclusively with the integral form of the 
transport equation and ways to solve it numerically.  Now, we return to the 
integro-differential form of the equation and introduce the \textit{discrete 
ordinates ($S_N$) method}, one of the most widely-used deterministic transport 
methods.  We subsequently introduce the method of \textit{source iteration} for 
treating the scattering source, for which two nonlinear acceleration 
schemes are presented in the next lecture.

\section*{A Discrete Angle Domain}

The integral methods of the last two lectures are useful in many applications because they effectively eliminate the angular variable.  If we are to treat the transport equation in its integro-differential form, we need a way to handle the angles.  For the sake of brevity, we limit our discussion to transport in slab geometry with isotropic sources and scattering, for which the transport equation reduces to
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
 \mu \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial x} + \Sigma_t(x)\psi(x,\mu) &= \frac{\Sigma_s(x)}{2}\int^1_{-1}d\mu' \psi(x,\mu') + \frac{S(x)}{2} \\
                                                               &= \frac{\Sigma_s(x)}{2}\phi(x) + \frac{S(x)}{2} \\
\end{split}
 \label{eq:slabtransportequation}
\end{equation}

The discrete ordinates method consists of requiring Eq. \ref{eq:slabtransportequation} to hold only for discrete values $\mu$.  In other words, we require
\begin{equation}
 \mu_n \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial x} + \Sigma_t(x)\psi(x,\mu_n) = \frac{\Sigma_s(x)}{2} \phi(x) + \frac{S(x)}{2} \, .
 \label{eq:snequation}
\end{equation}
What about $\phi$?  This is where the approximation is actually made.  Because we have $\psi$ only at discrete angles $\mu_n$, we cannot perform the continuous integral.  We do the next best thing and compute a weighted sum:
\begin{equation}
 \phi(x) \approx \sum^N_{n=1} w_n  \psi_n(x) \, ,
 \label{eq:phiquad}
\end{equation}
where we have introduced the notation $\psi_n(x) \equiv \psi(x,\mu_n)$.  

The only actual requirement on $w_n$ is that they satisfy
\begin{equation}
 \sum^N_{n=1} w_n = 2 \, ,
\end{equation}
since this sum represents $\int^1_{-1} d\mu = 2$.  Of course, we don't choose the weights arbitrarily, nor do we choose the cosines $\mu_n$ arbitrarily.  The choice of both is the art of numerical quadrature.

\section*{Intermission: Numerical Quadrature (a.k.a. Numerical Integration)}

You saw application of the \textit{trapezoid rule} in the integral transport code of Lecture \ref{lec:integral}.  You have probably seen the trapezoid rule in previous classes, and if not that, then certainly the even simpler \textit{Riemann sum} approximation to integrals, here in the form of the \textit{midpoint rule}:
\begin{equation}
 \int^b_a f(x)dx \approx  \Delta \sum^{N-1}_{n=0} f \Big ( a + (n+1/2)\Delta \Big ) \, ,
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
 \Delta = \frac{b-a}{N} \, ,
\end{equation}
and $N$ is the number of divisions in the center of which $f$ is evaluated.

The general form of a quadrature rule is
\begin{equation}
 \int^b_a f(x) dx \approx  \sum^{N-1}_{n=0} w_n f(x_n) \, , 
\end{equation}
and we see that the midpoint rule chooses equal weights $w_n = w = \Delta$ and evaluates $f$ at equally spaced points $x_n = a+(n+1/2)\Delta$.  The trapezoid rule also takes evenly spaced points, $x_n = a + n\Delta$, for $n = 0 \ldots N$, and with $w_0 = w_N = 0.5\Delta$, and $w_n = \Delta$, $0 < n < N$.

Other quadrature sets using evenly spaced points also exist.  One general class consists of the \textit{Newton-Cotes formulas}, which interpolate $f(x)$ using various order polynomials and thus allows for analytic integration.  The midpoint rule and the trapezoid rule are the simplest examples, using zeroth order and first order polynomials. Another example is \textit{Simpson's rule}, defined
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
 \int^b_a f(x) dx \approx & \frac{\Delta}{3} \Big ( f(a)+4f(a+\Delta) +2f(a+2\Delta)+4f(a+3\Delta) \\
                          &  +2f(a+4\Delta)+\ldots+ 4f(b-\Delta) + f(b) \Big ) \, .
\end{split}
\end{equation}
Simpson's rule is based on a piece-wise quadratic interpolation of sets of three points and can often be a very good ``quick and dirty'' way to integrate numerically. The reader is encouraged to consult a numerical analysis text for more details.

In many cases, it is possible to use fewer, non-equally spaced points (with unique weights) to yield accurate integral approximations that would otherwise take many equally spaced points.  One such scheme is Gauss-Legendre quadrature, which is the standard quadrature used to define $\phi$ in Eq. \ref{eq:phiquad}.  The $n$-point Gauss-Legendre scheme is constructed so that polynomials of degree less than or equal to $2n-1$ are integrated exactly over the domain of interest.  

Consider a 2-point Gauss-Legendre scheme, i.e. $\int^{1}_{-1} f(x)dx = w_1 f(x_1) + w_2 f(x_2)$.  We have four unknowns, so we need four equations.  The simplest case is to integrate the monomials $1$, $x$, $x^2$, and $x^3$ over the desired range.  Doing so, we get the set of equations
\begin{equation}
 \begin{split}
   \int^1_{-1} 1   dx = 2           & = w_1 + w_2  \\
   \int^1_{-1} x   dx = 0           & = w_1 x_1 + w_2 x_2  \\
   \int^1_{-1} x^2 dx = \frac{2}{3} & = w_1 x^2_1 + w_2 x^2_2  \\
   \int^1_{-1} x^3 dx = 0           & = w_1 x^3_1 + w_2 x^3_2  \, .
 \end{split}
\end{equation}
This system is solved for $w_1 = w_2 = 1$, $x_1 = -1/\sqrt{3}$, and $x_2 = 1/\sqrt{3}$.  Interestingly, $x_1$ and $x_2$ are the roots of the second-order Legendre polynomial $P_2(x) = x^2 - 1/3$.  In fact, the $x_i$ for any $n$-point Gauss-Legendre scheme are the $n$ roots of the $n$th order Legendre polynomial---hence the name of the quadrature rule\footnote{It should be noted that an entire class of Gaussian quadratures exists based on use of other sets of polynomials to approximate integrals where $f$ is weighted by some weighting function associated with the polynomials.  An important example is the Gauss-Chebyshev quadrature, where we approximate the integral $\int^1_{-1} \frac{f(x)}{\sqrt{1-x^2}}dx$. The $x_i$ are found to be roots of the Chebyshev polynomials.}. The weights are defined
\begin{equation}
 w_i = \frac{2(1-x^2_i)}{(n+1)^2(P_{n+1}(x_i))^2} \, .
\end{equation}
As a reference, the Gauss-Legendre abscissa and weights are given in Table \ref{tbl:gaussquad} for $N=2$, $4$, and $6$.  Note, odd orders are not used because the abscissa would then include $x=0$.  Since our goal is ultimately to integrate over $\mu$, and since we shall encounter terms with $1/\mu$, we simply avoid the singularity by choosing even $N$.

\section*{A Discrete Spatial Domain}

We next deal with the spatial variable, using the finite volume method.  Consider the discretization of Figure \ref{fig:sndisc}.  The slab is discretized into $I$ regions, each of which is assumed to have constant cross-sections and sources, denoted $\Sigma_{ti}$ and so forth.  The cell centers are given by $x_i$, and the cell edges by $x_{i\pm 1/2}$.  For a slab defined over $0 \leq x \leq L$, $x_{1/2} = 0$ and $x_{I+1/2} = L$.

\begin{figure}[ht] 
    \centering
    \includegraphics[keepaspectratio, width = 5.0 in]{images/sndisc}
    \caption{Discrete ordinates spatial discretization.}
    \label{fig:sndisc}
\end{figure}

Now, we integrate Eq. \ref{eq:snequation} over cell $i$:
\begin{equation}
  \int^{x_{i+\frac{1}{2}}}_{x_{i-\frac{1}{2}}} dx \Big ( \mu_n \frac{\partial \psi_n}{\partial x} + \Sigma_t(x)\psi_n(x) \Big ) =  \int^{x_{i+\frac{1}{2}}}_{x_{i-\frac{1}{2}}} dx  \Big ( \frac{\Sigma_s(x)}{2} \phi(x) + \frac{S(x)}{2} \Big ) \, ,
\end{equation}
so that
\begin{equation}
   \mu_n ( \psi_{i+\frac{1}{2},n} - \psi_{i-\frac{1}{2},n} ) + \Delta_i \Sigma_{ti}\psi_{i,n} =  \frac{\Delta_i}{2} \Big ( \Sigma_{is} \phi_i +  S_i \Big ) \, ,
\end{equation}
where $\Delta_i \equiv x_{i+\frac{1}{2}} - x_{i-\frac{1}{2}}$ and where the integrals have been approximated via the midpoint rule where needed.  For the sake of brevity, we switch to the emission density, defining
\begin{equation}
 Q_i =  (\Sigma_{is} \phi_i +  S_i)/2 \, ,
\end{equation}
so that
\begin{equation}
   \mu_n ( \psi_{i+\frac{1}{2},n} - \psi_{i-\frac{1}{2},n} ) + \Delta_i \Sigma_{ti}\psi_{i,n} =  \Delta_i Q_i \, .
   \label{eq:discsneq}
\end{equation}

Eq. \ref{eq:discsneq} is a good first step, but we're not done.  Imagine we know the angular flux entering the left side of slab $i$.  We would like to be able to compute the angular flux leaving $i$ to the right.  Doing exactly this over the entire domain is referred to as ``sweeping'' and is a common technique for hyperbolic problems, as it allows us to propagate boundary conditions along the direction of neutron paths.  The problem with Eq. \ref{eq:discsneq} is that we have another unknown: $\psi_{i,n}$, the cell-centered angular flux.  There are several approximations we can use, and we develop two: the diamond difference (DD) and step difference (SD) methods.

For both DD and SD, we define the cell-centered angular flux by
\begin{equation}
 \psi_{i,n} = \frac{1+\alpha_n}{2} \psi_{i+\frac{1}{2},n} + \frac{1-\alpha_n}{2} \psi_{i-\frac{1}{2},n}  \, ,
 \label{eq:ccpsi}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
 \alpha_n =
 \begin{cases} 0             &   \text{for DD}  \\
               |\mu_n|/\mu_n &   \text{for SD}  \\
 \end{cases} \, .
 \label{eq:alpha}
\end{equation}

The DD method is probably the most ubiquitous of the simple schemes available.  It essentially says the angular flux varies linearly within a cell, and it provides second-order accuracy.  Unfortunately, the DD method can lead to negative fluxes for $\Delta_i$ too large, demonstration of which is left as an exercise.  On the other hand, the SD method cannot yield negative fluxes, but is only first-order accurate.  For the SD method, note that the cell-center angular flux is equal to the outgoing angular flux at the edge.

\section*{Sweeping Formulas}

We hinted above that we can solve the discrete ordinates equations via use of sweeps across the domain.  In slab geometry, this consists of sweeps to the right for $\mu_n > 0$ and sweeps left for $\mu_n < 0$.  If we have vacuum or some other known boundary flux, we start with that condition, as reflective conditions require information from a sweep having come from the opposite direction.  If all conditions are reflective, a guess must be made for one, which will likely increase the number of iterations required (we'll get to iterations below).

Substituting Eq. \ref{eq:ccpsi} into Eq. \ref{eq:discsneq} and rearranging, we find for sweeping right
\begin{equation}
 \psi_{i+\frac{1}{2},n} = A^+_{i,n} \psi_{i-\frac{1}{2},n} + B^+_{i,n} Q_i \, ,
 \label{eq:rightsweep}
\end{equation}
and sweeping left
\begin{equation}
 \psi_{i-\frac{1}{2},n} = A^-_{i,n} \psi_{i+\frac{1}{2},n} + B^-_{i,n} Q_i \, , 
 \label{eq:leftsweep}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
 A^{\pm}_{i,n} = \frac{2\mu_n \mp (1 \mp \alpha_m)\Sigma_{ti}\Delta_i}{2\mu_n \pm (1 \pm \alpha_m)\Sigma_{ti}\Delta_i} \, , 
 \label{eq:Aconstant}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
 B^{\pm}_{i,n} = \frac{\pm 2 \Delta_i}{2\mu_n \pm (1 \pm \alpha_m)\Sigma_{ti}\Delta_i} \, .
 \label{eq:Bconstant}
\end{equation}

\section*{Source Iteration}

When we introduce scattering into the emission density, the right hand side becomes dependent on the solution.  A common way around this is the so-called source iteration method.  The source iteration method is related to the Neumann iteration scheme discussed in Lecture \ref{lec:integral}, and a connection between the two is left as an exercise.  

Source iteration is characterized by a right hand side that lags behind the left hand side.  More explicitly, we solve the equation
\begin{equation}
   \mu_n ( \psi^m_{i+\frac{1}{2},n} - \psi^m_{i-\frac{1}{2},n} ) + \Delta_i \Sigma_{ti}\psi^m_{i,n} =  \Delta_i Q^{m-1}_i \, ,
   \label{eq:discsneqsi}
\end{equation}
where $m$ is the iteration index and 
\begin{equation}
 Q^{m-1} = \frac{1}{2} (\Sigma_{is} \phi^{m-1}_i +  S_i) \, .
\end{equation}
For $m=1$, we need $q^0$.  Often, $\phi^0$ is simply set to zero, unless a better initial guess is easily made.  

The iterations continue until the updated fluxes change insignificantly.  This is usually quantified in a relative sense for the scalar flux by
\begin{equation}
 \frac{ \max | \phi^{m}-\phi^{m-1} |}{\phi^{m-1}}  < \epsilon_{\phi} \, 
 \label{eq:siconvergence}
\end{equation}
for some small $\epsilon_{\phi}$.

\section*{Acceleration}


\section*{A Simple Code}

Here, we provide a simple discrete ordinates code for computing the angular and scalar flux in a slab, given in Listing \ref{list:sn}.  The input requires region (coarse mesh) edge locations, within which the number of fine meshes are defined.  Each region is assigned a material index and volumetric source strength.  The total and scattering cross-sections represent values for different materials; each material can be placed in a region using the appropriate index.  This quick input format allows one to investigate fairly easily a wide range of slab compositions.

Currently, the code is limited to the DD and $S_4$ approximations and vacuum boundaries.  Convergence is tested for $\phi$ only.  The code returns the mesh-centered scalar flux and mesh-edge angular flux.  Within the solver, the notation follows the lecture notation relatively closely.

\section*{Further Reading}

A good introduction to the discrete ordinates method in one dimension can be found in 
Chapter 3 in Lewis and Miller \cite{lewis1993cmn}; higher dimensions are covered 
in Chapter 4 of the same work.  The foundation of the method is usually credited 
to Chandrasekhar (in the context of stellar radiation) and can be found in his 
monograph \cite{chandrasekhar1950rt}.  


Recent advances in the discrete ordinates method include employing advanced 
Krylov subspace methods, outlined by Warsa, Wareing, and Morel 
\cite{warsa2004kim}, variations of which are implemented in the state-of-the-art 
code Denovo \cite{evans2010dnt}.  Moreover, the discrete ordinates equations can 
be parallelized; the most popular approach is that of Koch, Baker, and Alcouffe 
\cite{koch1992sfo} (also implemented in Denovo).

For more information on numerical quadrature, see any number of numerical 
analysis books.  Also, MIT course 18.335 is also highly recommended, as it 
covers numerical quadrature and many other aspects of numerical methods 
(including a heavy focus on numerical linear algebra).

\begin{exercises}

  \item \textbf{Negative fluxes}. Using the DD method, express the sweeping step relation in the form
  \begin{equation*}
    \psi_{3/2,n} = A \psi_{1/2,n} + B \, ,
  \end{equation*}
  where $\mu_n > 0$ and $A$ and $B$ are constants to be determined, and eliminate any $\alpha$ terms.  Under what conditions can $\psi_{3/2,n}$ be negative?  Under what conditions, if any, can $\phi_{1,n}$ be negative?  While negative fluxes are not inherently bad numerically, they don't make much physical sense.  Suggest a method for ``fixing'' negative fluxes.

  \item \textbf{Step Difference}.  Implement the step difference method.\footnote{Note, in this and other exercises you are asked to use or modify the given $S_N$ code.  It is also acceptable to use your own code, either written from scratch or via modification of the one given.}

  \item \textbf{Step Characteristic}.  The step characteristic (SC) scheme is another differencing approach based on analytical integration of the transport equation over the fine mesh cell, yielding for example
  \begin{equation*}
    \psi_{i+\frac{1}{2},n}  =  \psi_{i-\frac{1}{2},n} e^{- \frac{\Delta_i \Sigma_{ti}}{\mu}} + \frac{Q_i}{2\Sigma_{ti}} \Big ( 1-e^{-\frac{\Delta_i \Sigma_{ti}}{\mu}} \Big ) \, .
  \end{equation*}
  \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item Derive an expression for $\alpha_{mi}$ as in Eq. \ref{eq:alpha} for use with the SC method.  Note that $\alpha$ in this case is also indexed by the fine mesh index $i$. 
    \item Implement the SC method.
  \end{enumerate}
 
  \item \textbf{Accuracy}.  Here, we want to investigate the accuracy of various difference methods.  To do so, we will use a known analytical solution for as a reference.  See e.g. Appendix A of LeVeque \cite{leveque2007fdm} for more on error analysis.
  \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item Using the $S_6$ approximation, solve \textit{analytically} the discrete ordinates equations for the sample slab problem of Lecture \ref{lec:analytical}.  Implement this reference solution as a function in MATLAB (or your language of choice), so that $\phi(x)$ can be evaluated for any value of $x$.        
    \item Using the DD approximation, solve the $S_6$ equations using 10, 20, 40, 80, and 160, and 320 meshes.  For each case, compute the absolute value of the maximum error between the DD and analytical solution for $\phi$, i.e. find 
    \begin{equation*}
     e^{\text{DD}}_I = \max_{1\leq i \leq I} \Big|\phi^{\text{DD}}_{i}-\phi_{i}^{\text{ref}} \Big |  \, .
    \end{equation*}
    \item Do the same for the SD method.
    \item We say a method is $p$th order accurate if $e(\Delta) \propto \Delta^p$.  Estimate $p$ for both methods. 
    \item Plot the errors for both methods as a function of $\Delta$.  Include also the functions $a\Delta^1$ and $b\Delta^2$, where $a$ and $b$ are constants chosen to yield a nice plot.  Hint: use a log-log plot.
   \end{enumerate}

  \item \textbf{Accuracy: Part Deux}.  Here, we want to investigate the accuracy of the Gauss-Legendre quadrature and hence $S_N$ order.  
  \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item Compute $\phi(x)$ analytically for the sample slab problem of Lecture \ref{lec:analytical}, and make this available as a function.
    \item Compute $\phi$ analytically using the $S_N$ method for orders 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64.  You will have to look up the quadrature parameters for $N > 4$.  
    \item Compute the errors in $\phi$ as in the last problem for $x = 5.0$ and plot as a function of $N$.  
    \item Estimate the ``$p$'' value as in the last problem and comment.  
   \end{enumerate}


  \item \textbf{Reflective Conditions}. Modify the given $S_N$ code to handle reflective conditions, and solve the following problems...

  \item \textbf{CMR}.  Implement CMR in the given $S_N$ code.  Test it on the following problems, using a variety of coarse mesh sizes...

  \item \textbf{CMFD}.  Read the paper by Zhong et al. \cite{zhong2008itl} and derive the CMFD equations in 1-d.  Implement the method in the $S_N$ code and compare it to CMR for the slab configuration given in the last problem.

  \item \textbf{Discrete Ordinates Matrix}.  The discrete ordinates equations are simply a set of coupled differential equations discretized in space and angle.  Consequently, we can express the equations in matrix form.  Consider a uniform slab ($\Sigma_t$ and $\Sigma_s$) with a uniform isotropic source of volumetric strength $S$. Suppose we discretize this slab into three cells of equal width $\Delta$.  Using an $S_2$ approximation with the DD method, and assuming vacuum conditions:
  \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item Cast the sweep-based source iteration scheme in matrix form, expressing the right hand vector in terms of $Q$, the emission density.         
    \item Reformulate the equations so that the source term is brought to the left hand side, thus enabling a direct solution of the equations without source iteration.  
   \end{enumerate}
  For $\Sigma_t = 1.0$, $\Sigma_s = 0.5$, $\Delta = 1.0$, and $S = 1.0$, verify your expressions from parts (a) and (b).  For more on part (b), see the paper by Patton and Holloway \cite{patton2002apg}.

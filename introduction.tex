\chapter*{Introduction}


This set of lectures derives from the class 22.106, Neutron 
Interactions and Applications, formerly taught at MIT.  I wrote these
while a TA under my advisor Dr.~Benoit Forget, the instructor of the course.
I continued to develop the notes as I taught 22.106 myself during my final 
semester of study as an Instructor-G (which happens also to be the 
last time the course was taught, for better or worse).

Although 22.106 covered a wide range of topics, ranging from 
the R-matrix theory to deterministic transport, these notes are 
limited to aspects of neutron transport that are important for 
reactor physics and shielding.  The primary focus is on \emph{numerical}
methods, but some analytical techniques are developed where appropriate.

I've drawn from the original content of 22.106 along with a course I 
had previously at Wisconsin (with Dr. Douglass Henderson) and my 
own research.  Some of the lectures are in better shape than others, and 
I intend to update them all as time allows and as I receive input from
my own students. \\

\chapter{Coupling Transport to Other Physics}

In \LECTURE{time_dependent_transport}, we developed numerical 
schemes for the solution of time-dependent problems.  In this 
lecture, we extend that development to include transient dependence
on other physics such that cross sections and other system 
coefficients depend, in some manner, on the particle flux.  We'll 
identify two basic approaches for the solving such coupled-physics 
problems and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each.

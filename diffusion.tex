\chapter{Numerical Solution of the Diffusion Equation}
\label{app:diffusion}

We covered the $P_N$ equations and how the diffusion equation is formally derived in Lecture \ref{lec:pn_method_and_diffusion}.  In this lecture, we revisit the diffusion equation for slab geometry and develop a straightforward differencing scheme for its numerical solution.  We provide a simple code that performs multigroup diffusion for fixed source and eigenvalue (reactor) problems.

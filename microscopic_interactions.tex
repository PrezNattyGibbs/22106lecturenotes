\chapter{Microscopic Interactions}
\epigraph{  \begin{SingleSpace} Life is made up of small pleasures. Happiness is made up of those tiny successes. The big ones come too infrequently. And if you don't collect all these tiny successes, the big ones don't really mean anything. \end{SingleSpace} }{Norman Lear}
